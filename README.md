# rollDiceGame_javascript

This is a simple double player game built in javascript.

A player can either continue to roll dice or hold it. Until he keeps rolling dice , the rolled dice number keeps on getting added to his score and if he holds then the added score becomes the total score.However,if he gets 1 while rolling dice, then he loses all his added points from the total score.
When he gets 1 on rolled dice or, holds, then second user can roll dice and vice versa.
The one to reach 100 total score first wins the game.
